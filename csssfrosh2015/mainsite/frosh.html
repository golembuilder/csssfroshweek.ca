					<p><b>Registration and BBQ:</b> Whether you have registered online or are planning to register in person on this day, come out for a free BBQ and to meet some of your professors and other CS students for the first time. Look for the registration booth to get your t-shirt and swag before heading out for the feast..<br><span><i>Location: SFU Burnaby, ASB Atrium</i></span></p>
					
					
					<p><b>RAM'ing Invocation Ceremony:</b> You, the few, the proud, and the chosen shall be anointed with a token of fellowship as CS students. This ancient and mystical ceremony must be faced with awe and reverence!<br><span><i>Location: SFU Burnaby, TBA</i></span></p>
					
					
					<p><b>Information Session:</b> Learn about Co-op, Computing Science, Women in Computing Science, and the Computing Science Student Society.  Learn about all the opportunities open to you and what to look forward to in your four (or more) years at SFU.  Food and refreshments will be provided as you have a chance to talk with the computing science students and co-op advisors.<br><span><i>Location: SFU Burnaby, IRMACS Theatre</i></span></p>
					

					<p><b>Survival Training:</b> Surviving your first year at SFU involves cunning, strategy, and the ability to dodge people in the hallways.  What better way to practice these skills then with a game of capture the flag!  Join others in your <span class="emphasis">House</span> and crush those that oppose you!<br><span><i>Location: AQ Gardens</i></span></p>
                    
                    <p><b>Stencyl Workshop:</b> Intended for new students with <strong>zero</strong> experience in programming, this series of progressive workshops will introduce you to general programming concepts without having to worry about syntax and other issues.  Work together with your <span class="emphasis">House</span> to plan out and create a simple 2D game.  At the end of the week, you get to play the games that everyone else made, and show off your own!<span><i>Location: SFU Burnaby, ASB Atrium + TASC 9204</i></span></p>

					<p><b>Photo Hunt:</b>There are so many strange things in our beautiful city, and in this event you'll get the chance to see them! Perhaps there will also be a secret mission on behalf of your <span class="emphasis">House</span> in order to defend your honour. Want to know more? Well, you'll just have to wait, won't you... <br><span><i>Location: Starts at SFU Burnaby, ASB Atrium. Goes downtown, returns to SFU Burnaby.</i></span></p>

					<p><b>Team Strategy Dinner:</b>As you lick your wounds from the field of battle, know that it was but a small rehearsal in a larger campaign. As you sit amongst your brethren, fill your stomach with food so that it may prepare you for the events that lay ahead of you. Discuss strategy and seek wisdom from your leaders. Above all, prepare yourself for a long night of hunting, cheering and celebration as you will match wits with yourself, your peers and most dastardly of all: the filthy engineers.<br><span><i>Location: SFU Burnaby, Club Ilia</i></span></p>

					<p><b>Midnight Madness:</b> Learn the joy of all-nighters with all of the fun and none of the work! First, help us to once again crush the Engineers in our Frosh Slurpee drink-off, dodgeball game, and tug-of-war. We'll then proceed to keep you up all night with an adrenaline filled race around campus containing copious quantities of games (both video and non), more random prize opportunities and other such mischief. <br><br>Make sure to tell your parents not to wait up. You'll be... studying... This event goes all night so prepare to be at SFU till the early hours of the morning on Saturday. Prizes will be given out in the middle of the night for the points you earned during the week, so make sure to stay in order to guarantee yourself something nice.<span><i>Location: SFU Burnaby, ASB Atrium + TASC 9204</i></span></p>

					<p style="text-align:center"><b>What's the difference between FroshWeek and <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/students/orientation/new-students.html">SFU Welcome Day</a>?</p></b></p>
					<p style="text-align:center"><p>SFU Welcome Day is a very informative event held in August that teaches you where stuff on campus is, how to be successful, and prepares you for a solid start at university. You will meet one upper-year student, called your Orientation Leader (OL) who may or may not be in Computing Science, and ~15 other students in Applied Science. It's useful, especially for those who don't know the campus very well. FroshWeek is just pure, unadulterated FUN, and is for all CS students, regardless of how well you know the campus. You will meet dozens of wise upper-year students and other first years in CS. You will learn things the Orientation Leaders aren't allowed to tell you. You'll compete for awesome prizes, and receive tons of food. You'll make memories that you'll look back on 20 years down the road. Awesome! FroshWeek is the easiest way to meet  people, and is completely different from the 2 days of information you'll receive during SFU Orientation.</p>

					<p style="text-align:center"><b>Will there be alcohol?</b></p>
					<p style="text-align:center">No! We will not be providing you with alcohol.</p>

					<p style="text-align:center"><b>Is Frosh Week worth it?</b></p>
					<p style="text-align:center">Definitely! This is going to be the best week of your undergraduate life. Also, it’s a great way to instantly make friends and know the ins and outs of campus and school life!</p>

					<p style="text-align:center"><b>Do I need to attend all the events in the schedule as I have classes that conflicts with them?</b></p>
					<p style="text-align:center">We know that we have lots going on during the first week and although it would be great to attend all of them we know it is not realistically possible. So we have marked the events that are essential to go to, i.e. Registration BBQ and Midnight Madness.. If you have any classes that conflicts with those events contact us using <a href="mailto:csss@sfu.ca">csss@sfu.ca</a> as early as possible and we'll let you know what to do.</p>

					<p style="text-align:center"><b>What is the best way to get more information about FroshWeek?</b></p>
					<p style="text-align:center">
The best way to get information is checking the website periodically since we add more content to it as we get closer to FroshWeek. However if you have a question that hasn't been answered, send our <a href="mailto:csss@sfu.ca">team</a> an email and we will get back to you as soon as possible. If it is a general question we will post it on the website for everybody else as well.</p>

					<p style="text-align:center"><b>I am unable to make an event. Can events be missed, entered late, or left early?</b></p>

Yes. We understand that students may not be able to make every event. Although, we would prefer it if all participants were able to make these events: Registration BBQ, RAMing Ceremony, PacMacro and Late Night Lunacy as they are essential to the FroshWeek experience. If you need to leave an event early, just let a Frosh leader know what's going on. If you need to join an event late, please find out before hand where we will be, as some of our events will move around to different areas.</p>

					<p style="text-align:center"><b>I have a lab/tutorial during one of the events.</b></p>
					<p style="text-align:center">
It isn't mentioned in your schedule, but generally during the first week of classes there are no tutorials or labs. Make sure you still attend your lecture and be attentive, ensuring this is the case for your class. However, you will likely be able to attend the event.</p>

					<p style="text-align:center"><b>I am located at the Surrey campus, can I still attend FroshWeek?</b></p>
					<p style="text-align:center">
Although some of the events are held at the Burnaby campus, FroshWeek is open to any and all Computing Science Students. Feel free to come join us for any of the events that you are able to make. Unfortunately some events will be during your classes at Surrey, other events are held later in the day or in downtown Vancouver. Check out the <a href="schedule.html">schedule</a> for more details on event locations and times. Additionally, Software Systems and Mechatronics have their own FroshWeek events at the Surrey campus.</p>

                    <p style="text-align:center"><b>How much does FroshWeek cost?</b></p>
					<p style="text-align:center">It's free!</p>

					<p style="text-align:center"><b>Do I have to go to every event?</b></p>
					<p style="text-align:center">While we do recommend you go to every event, of course you don’t have to. But going to all the events gives you the full experience of Frosh Week, as well as New College and the rest of campus. Plus, let’s be honest, free food AND free stuff is a combination you don’t want to miss. Especially when there’s the possibility that you meet someone awesome just 5 minutes later.</p>

					<p style="text-align:center"><b>I am a mature student or am already very familiar with campus and services offered. Do I still need to go?</b></p>
					<p style="text-align:center">Yes! Of course! Don't think of FroshWeek as an orientation, but a chance to meet a lot of the people you will be studying and working with for the next few years and party it up a little. The point of it all, aside from meeting people, is to have fun!</p>

					<p style="text-align:center"><b>What if I don't know anyone?</b></p>
					<p style="text-align:center">
Don’t worry! Everyone is in the same boat! Start with a simple “Hey, my name is” and you should be fine. If you’re super concerned about not knowing anyone, we’re going to put you in small groups first so that you can be more comfortable.</p>

					<p>Orientation was the best week of my university career thus far! As an old New College Orientation Leader once told me, frosh is the one event during your years spent at UofT that you remember during your last day at Convocation.</p>

					<h4><b>Filippo Giliberti</b></h4>
					<p>Hello New Gnu College students! My name is Filippo and I think I'm among the biggest fans of Frosh. Wanna know why? The reason is simple... Frosh is AMAZING because it gives us the possibility to get out of our shells. Being a yellow t-shirt was the best experience I had so far and helped me to build the friendships I'll remember for all my life. So, you, new students, don't be afraid to wear your yellow t-shirt.  Don't be afraid to cheer with your leaders.  Don't be afraid to say "Hi!, what up?" to an other new Gnu student. This year I'm wearing the green t-shirt, so I'm on the other side, trying to inspire you, trying to make you dance, trying to make you smile all week long. So if you see me around just say "Ciao Filippo! Che fai?". </p>

					<h4><b>Katrina Chiu</b></h4>
					<p>I can still remember everything I felt the first morning of Frosh – apprehensive (had I, by some miracle, picked the right college at random?), jetlagged (having flown in to Toronto the day before on a 15 hour flight), and lonely (not knowing a single face in a sea of yellow frosh shirts). By the end of the week, every anxious thought and uneasy feeling I had dissipated entirely. The very same strangers in yellow shirts became future fellow frosh leaders and good friends to this day. All traces of homesickness vanished as quickly as my voice did in every event that were as equally engaging as they were exhausting. From my experiences solely based on Orientation, I knew I had done right by choosing to be a part of New College and its incredibly supportive, dynamic community.</p>

					<h4><b>Emma Lawrence</b></h4>
					<p>Frosh Week was an amazing experience for me. It really brought me out of my shell. I've always been fairly shy, but I quickly found a group of friends in the first few days of Frosh. Getting all decked out in New College colours and paint made me feel like a part of something, and I was able to come out of my comfort zone, because chanting and making friends and being crazy was the cool thing to do. I'm so happy with my Frosh experience and it's made me want to go back as a Frosh Leader this year to help the next batch of NC students feel just as home as I am at U of T.</p>
