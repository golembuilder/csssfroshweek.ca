			<h3>FroshWeek Founders</h3>
			<p>
			The five day long welcoming activities at Simon Fraser known as FroshWeek have been held annually by the CSSS 
			for the past nine years. Without the continued support from both its executive board and members alike, an event 
			as big as this could not of been successful. Going into its ninth year, the society is responsible for planning, 
			organizing, hosting and promoting the event. Without the society's support the FroshWeek tradition could not be 
			enjoyed by the generations to come.
